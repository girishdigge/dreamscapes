## How to Run Tests

### Browser (Development)

```bash
# Open in browser
start services/render-worker/puppeteer/engine/__tests__/run-all-tests.html
```

### Command Line (CI/CD)

```bash
# Run via Node.js
cd services/render-worker/puppeteer/engine/__tests__
node run-tests.js
```

All tests are designed to:

- ✅ Run independently without side effects
- ✅ Be deterministic (same input = same output)
- ✅ Provide clear error messages
- ✅ Cover edge cases and error conditions
- ✅ Validate performance requirements
- ✅ Support both browser and headless execution
