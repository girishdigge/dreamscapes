- [x] Close-up shot (focus on object) - `applyCloseUpShot()`
- [x] Pull-back shot (zoom out reveal) - `applyPullBackShot()`
- [x] Requirements 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 satisfied

## Subtask 6.3: Implement shot timing and transitions ✅

- [x] Calculate current shot based on time - `_getCurrentShot()`
- [x] Smoothly interpolate between shots - `interpolatePosition()`
- [x] Easing functions implemented:
  - [x] `_easeInCubic()`
  - [x] `_easeOutCubic()`
  - [x] `_easeInOutCubic()`
  - [x] `_linear()`
  - [x] `_applyEasing()` dispatcher
- [x] Apply shot duration constraints
- [x] Progress calculation (0-1) within shot
- [x] Requirements 7.6, 7.7 satisfied

## Subtask 6.4: Implement camera targeting ✅

- [x] Support target as structure ID (string)
- [x] Support target as coordinates (array [x,y,z])
- [x] Support target as object ({x,y,z})
- [x] Implement lookAt functionality
- [x] `_resolveTarget()` handles all formats
- [x] Scene object lookup by name
- [x] Default orbital view when no cinematography specified
- [x] Requirements 7.8, 7.9 satisfied

## Integration Verification ✅

- [x] Browser compatibility (window export)
- [x] Proper error handling (unknown shot types)

## Testing ✅

- [x] Test HTML file created (test-camera-controller.html)
- [x] Visual verification possible
- [x] All shot types testable
- [x] Time scrubbing works
- [x] Multiple shot sequences work
