## Test Results

### Build Script

```bash
$ node services/render-worker/puppeteer/build-template.js
Building 3D render template...
Reading MaterialSystem.js...
Reading AnimationController.js...
Reading CameraController.js...
Reading AssetLibrary.js...
Reading SceneRenderer.js...
✓ Successfully embedded all engine modules
✓ Template size: 115.55 KB
✓ Build complete!
```

### File Verification

```bash
$ wc -l services/render-worker/puppeteer/templates/render_template_3d.html
3903 services/render-worker/puppeteer/templates/render_template_3d.html

$ grep -n "^class " services/render-worker/puppeteer/templates/render_template_3d.html
80:class MaterialSystem {
670:class AnimationController {
967:class CameraController {
1398:class AssetLibrary {
2918:class SceneRenderer {
```

### Code Diagnostics

```bash
$ getDiagnostics build-template.js test-3d-template.js
No diagnostics found
```

## Manual Testing Steps

1. Open `test-3d-template-manual.html` in a web browser
2. Click "Load Template" button
3. Wait for status to show "Template loaded! Three.js ready"
4. Click "Initialize Scene" button
5. Verify scene renders with star and planet
6. Click "Seek to t=0" button
7. Click "Seek to t=5" button
8. Verify camera position changes
9. Click "Seek to t=0" again
10. Verify render is identical to step 6 (deterministic)

### Expected Visual Results

- Black space background with purple/blue nebula effect
- Yellow glowing star in center with corona
- Blue planet with atmosphere to the right
- Camera orbits around scene as time progresses
- Debug info in top-left: "3D Renderer | time: X.XXs | structures: 2 | entities: 0 | quality: medium"
