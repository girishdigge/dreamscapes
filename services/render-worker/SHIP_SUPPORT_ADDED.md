# Ship Support Added to 3D Renderer

**Date:** 2025-10-05  
**Issue:** Backend generating "ship" type that wasn't supported in renderer

## Problem

The backend was generating dream JSON with:

- Structure type: "ocean" (already supported ✓)
- Entity type: "ship" with count: 27 (NOT supported ✗)

This caused the renderer to fall back to generic boxes, resulting in a "giant square box in center" with "random objects moving across".

## Solution

Added comprehensive ship support to the 3D renderer:

### 1. Ship as Structure Type

Added `createShip()` method that creates a detailed ship model with:

- **Hull**: Elongated box for the main body
- **Bow**: Cone-shaped front (pointed section)
- **Deck**: Flat top surface
- **Mast**: Vertical pole
- **Sail**: White cloth plane with slight curve

**Usage:**

```json
{
  "structures": [
    {
      "id": "s1",
      "type": "ship",
      "pos": [0, 0, 0],
      "scale": 1.0,
      "material": { "color": "#8b4513" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Ship as Entity Type

Added `createShipEntity()` method that creates multiple ship instances:

- Creates a group of ships (up to 50 max)
- Positions them in a scattered formation
- Varies sizes for realism
- Adds velocity for animation
- Each ship can move independently

**Usage:**

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": "e1",
      "type": "ship",
      "count": 27,
      "params": {
        "speed": 0.7,
        "size": 1.0,
        "color": "#a6d8ff"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Changes Made

### File: `services/render-worker/puppeteer/templates/render_template_3d.html`

#### 1. Updated Structure Type Switch (Line ~1790)

```javascript
// Added ship support
case 'ship':
case 'boat':
  mesh = this.createShip(structure);
  break;
```

#### 2. Added createShip() Method (After createBridge)

Creates a detailed 3D ship model with hull, bow, deck, mast, and sail.

#### 3. Updated Entity Type Switch (Line ~1910)

```javascript
// Added ship entity support
case 'ship':
case 'boat':
  object = this.createShipEntity(entity);
  break;
```

#### 4. Added createShipEntity() Method (After createLightButterflies)

Creates multiple ship instances in a formation with animation support.

## Testing

### Test with Backend JSON

The backend JSON that was failing:

```json
{
  "structures": [
    {
      "id": "s1",
      "type": "ocean",
      "pos": [0, 13.75, 0],
      "scale": 0.86,
      "features": ["glowing_edges"]
    }
  ],
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": "e1",
      "type": "ship",
      "count": 27,
      "params": {
        "speed": 0.74,
        "glow": 0.97,
        "size": 1.05,
        "color": "#a6d8ff"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Result:**

- Ocean surface with glowing edges at position [0, 13.75, 0]
- 27 ships scattered in a formation
- Ships colored light blue (#a6d8ff)
- Ships moving at speed 0.74
- Ships sized at 1.05x scale

## Backward Compatibility

✓ All existing structure and entity types still work  
✓ No breaking changes to API  
✓ Unknown types still fall back to generic structures  
✓ Parameter validation still applies

## Additional Notes

### Ship Model Details

- **Hull dimensions**: 20x6x8 units
- **Bow**: Cone-shaped, 8 units long
- **Mast height**: 20 units
- **Sail size**: 12x15 units
- **Materials**: Brown hull, white sail

### Ship Entity Behavior

- Ships positioned in circular formation
- Radius: 20-50 units from center
- Height variation: ±2 units
- Each ship has independent velocity
- Rotation aligned with movement direction

### Performance

- Each ship is ~6 meshes (hull, bow, deck, mast, sail)
- 27 ships = ~162 meshes total
- Well within performance limits for medium quality
- Uses geometry caching for efficiency

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. Add wave bobbing animation to ships
2. Add wake/water splash particles
3. Support for different ship types (sailboat, cargo, cruise)
4. Animated sails (wind effect)
5. Ship lights for night scenes

## Status

✓ **COMPLETE** - Ship support fully implemented and tested
