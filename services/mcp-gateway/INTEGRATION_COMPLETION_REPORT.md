## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### ProviderManager Integration

```javascript
// Enhanced provider selection with intelligent fallback
const result = await providerManager.executeWithFallback(
  async (provider, providerName, context) => {
    return await provider.generateDream(prompt, options);
  },
  null, // Automatic provider selection
  {
    maxAttempts: 5,
    timeout: 30000,
    preserveContext: true,
    operationType: 'generateDream',
  }
);
```

### Performance Optimization

```javascript
// Request queuing and rate limiting
app.use(performanceMiddleware.middleware());

// Resource management and monitoring
const resourceMetrics = performanceMiddleware.getResourceMetrics();
const optimizationRecommendations =
  performanceMiddleware.getOptimizationRecommendations();
```

### Validation Pipeline

```javascript
// Automatic content validation and repair
const pipelineResult = await validationPipeline.validateAndRepair(
  content,
  'dreamResponse',
  { originalPrompt: text, provider: source, style: style }
);
```
